# House-Price-Prediction
This is a project to predict the real estate price using linear regression algorithm.
- Firstly, I have explored the data in various ways which includes numerical analysis using describe method, univariate and bivariate analysis using matplotlib library.
- I have then manipulated the data by dealing with missing values and droppng off duplicate values in the data set
- In the third stage, I have applied the linear regression algorithm to my prediction model.
- Finally, the model is validated using RMSLE evaluation metric and has given a score of 94%
